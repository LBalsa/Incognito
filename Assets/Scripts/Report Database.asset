      of the incident\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 During recreational time, Miss Abigail
      Caperton had some sort of psychotic break, and started punching the wall and
      speaking some Latin words. As guard Frances approached the patient, he grabbed
      her by the arm. I was watching from a distance but I could tell he was using
      some unnecessary force. Miss Abigail was struggling and I decided to approach
      to help. as I was on my way, I noticed Abigail struggling even more and without
      any apparent reason, guard Frances slapped Abigail. When I confronted him he
      said she had bitten him, which I haven\u2019t seen and when I examined his hand
      I couldn\u2019t find any bite marks. After this incident, I took Abigail to
      her room, gave her some medicines and left her to rest.\r\n\r\nDoes injury require

      of the incident\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 I was walking down the hall when I heard
      muffled screams coming from the East Wing toilets. Once I arrived I was mortified
      to see the patient Christian E. Shade lying bloody on the floor, and guard Roderick
      Campbell covering the patient\u2019s mouth with his hand. \r\nGuard Roderick\u2019s
      baton was on the floor, also bloody, and when I confronted him about what happened
      he told me he heard some screams and found the patient on the floor, saying
      that he might have slipped on the wet floor. When confronted about being muffling
      the patient\u2019s screams he said he didn\u2019t want to bring attention on
      themselves, which I found suspicious. Guard Roderick was aware that he was breaking
      the protocol by not have called a nurse immediately.  When I approached the
      victim, I could clearly see bruises consistent with the Guard\u2019s baton format.
      \ Christian was screaming in pain, and when I asked him what happened he told
      me he went to the toilet when Guard Roderick approached him and hit his head
      on the sink. Christian fell on the floor and the guard beat him repeatedly with
      his baton on the head, torso and chest. \r\n\r\nDoes injury require hospital/physician\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Yes

      and only got into action after Mr. Tucker jab a fork on Mr. Jenkins left eye.
      When I questioned them both about what happened they were confused and couldn\u2019t
      give a proper motive, which makes me believe they were having some kind of delusion.

      that the patient had gotten up to use the toilet. Then I realized it was taking
      too much time.\r\nI then decided to check the toilets, and gave the notice to
      my colleague to stay aware and check if the patient hadn\u2019t gone outside
      the building.\r\nI went to the ladies room, and for my surprise it was empty.
      Starting to believe that Miss Watson escaped, I went to the men\u2019s toilet
      and found the patient unconscious on the floor. She had bruises as she has been
      beaten. I tried calling her name, she looked at me, gasping for air, I tried
      to lift her but she fainted. I immediately called Nurse Gibson and an ambulance.

      They spent the past weeks \u201Ctorturing\u201D me. It didn\u2019t had any kind

      awake\u2026\r\nThe nurses couldn\u2019t understand what was happening to me.
      I was losing a battle against myself over and over again when I had already
      been under control. My body is a mess right now. I lost a few days of sleep;
      I would hurt myself to make those memories stop.\r\nThe guards stopped coming

      all the suffering they\u2019ve been causing\u2026 one of us even died\u2026
      \r\n I know how some of us got sick\u2026 one of the guards poisoned us\u2026
      I don\u2019t know his name, to be honest these guards all look like monkeys
      with batons to me but anyways, I saw him sneak into the kitchen and dropped
      something in our food. At first I thought it was just some spice but after some
      of us got sick, I knew something was off..\r\nOnce again I tried to tell the
      director but who would believe a lunatic\u2026 they have been mistreating us
      and in the end, I am the bad guy\u2026 how ironic. Let me tell you something\u2026
      I entered Dr. \u201Cexpensive suit\u201D office and found some incident reports.
      He knows what\u2019s happening in this place, but I believe he doesn\u2019t
      care. Who would care about a bunch of lunatics anyway? \r\nI am not done with
      this dear diary! I will fight and one day people will believe me. They will
      see me as the Stillwater Mental Asylum Hero.\r\nNow I have to go, they are coming
      with my medicines.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA.Jame"
