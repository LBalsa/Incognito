Details of the incident………… During recreational time, Miss Abigail Caperton had some sort of psychotic break, and started punching the wall and speaking some Latin words. As guard Frances approached the patient, he grabbed her by the arm. I was watching from a distance but I could tell he was using some unnecessary force. Miss Abigail was struggling and I decided to approach to help. as I was on my way, I noticed Abigail struggling even more and without any apparent reason, guard Frances slapped Abigail. When I confronted him he said she had bitten him, which I haven’t seen and when I examined his hand I couldn’t find any bite marks. After this incident, I took Abigail to her room, gave her some medicines and left her to rest.
